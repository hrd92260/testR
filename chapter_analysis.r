# In order to check whether size is significantly associated with species, we could perform a Chi-square test of independence since both variables are categorical variables. See how to do this test by hand and in R.

# Instead of having the frequencies (i.e.. the number of cases) you can also have the relative frequencies (i.e., proportions) in each subgroup by adding the table() function inside the prop.table() function:
prop.table(table(dataset$year, dataset$director))

# Note that you can also compute the percentages by row or by column by adding a second argument to the prop.table() function: 1 for row, or 2 for column:
round(prop.table(table(dataset$year, dataset$director), 1), 2) # round to 2 digits with round()

# percentages by column:
round(prop.table(table(dataset$year, dataset$director), 2), 2)

# We can customize the contents using custom renderers.

# Here, for example, we specify render functions for the continuous and categorical variables as follows:

my.render.cont <- function(x) {
